# Create a changelog between two branches

This action compares two branches and returns a changelog with the PR titles and authors.

## Usage

You can now consume the action by referencing the v1 branch

```yaml
- name: Generate branchlog
  uses: alexiabalionis/branchlog@1.1.1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    repository: branch_name
    owner: organization_name
    base_branch: main
    feature_branch: homolog
    pr_state: closed
```

## Contributing

### Code in Main

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run prepare

```bash
npm run prepare
```

Since the packaged index.js is run from the dist folder.

```bash
git add dist
```

## Create a release branch

Users shouldn't consume the action from master since that would be latest code and actions can break compatibility between major versions.

Checkin to the v1 release branch

```bash
git checkout -b v1
git commit -a -m "v1 release"
```

```bash
git push origin v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.
